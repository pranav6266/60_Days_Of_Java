I am following along a Java Course in Udemy called "60 Days of Java : The Complete Java Masterclass
". And I would like to share the concepts I have learnt and the solution of the problem statements I have solved.

In this repo, I will be uploading new file daily in which I will make a text file which will contain that day's learning.
One file for the problem statements and then the solution of those statements.

Do checkout the repo. Might be useful if you are just starting out.
