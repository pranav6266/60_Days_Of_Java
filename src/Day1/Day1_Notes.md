### Displaying Text On The Screen
In Java, you can display text using the "System.out.println" command. This command shows the text and moves to a new line.\
Example: System.out.println("Hello, World!");\
\
Explanation:
1. System.out.println: Tells the computer to display text. 
2. Parentheses (): Enclose the text to be shown. 
3. Double Quotes "": Enclose the exact text to be displayed. 
4. Semicolon ;: Ends the instruction

### Different Types of Print Statements
1. System.out.println()
2. System.out.print() : This command shows the text and stays in the same line.
3. System.out.printf() : This command is used when you need to format the displayed text according to required format.\

### Usage of "\n"
"\n" is used inside of double quotes to go to the next line without using another println statement.

### Note
1. To use double quotes in the display statement, use "\\" before the double quotes. 
2. To display "\\n" without jumping to the next line, we use "\\\n".
